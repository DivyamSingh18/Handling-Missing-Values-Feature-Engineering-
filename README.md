# Handling-Missing-Values-Feature-Engineering-
<b>Why do you need to fill in the missing data?</b><br> Because most of the machine learning models that you want to use will provide an error if you pass NaN values into it. The easiest way is to just fill them up with 0, but this can reduce your model accuracy significantly.  For filling missing values, there are many methods available. <br>

* For numerical variables: <br>
   >Mean Mode Median Imputation <br>
   >Random sample Imputation <br>
   >Arbitrary Imputation <br>
   >End of Distribution Imputation <br>
   >Capturing NAN Values with a new Feature <br>

 * For Categorical variables: <br>
   >Frequent category imputation <br>
   >Add a missing category <br>

 * For Both: <br>
   >Random sample imputation <br>
   >Capturing NaN Values with a New Feature
